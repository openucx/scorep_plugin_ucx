# scorep_plugin_UCX

Score-P UCX data acquisition plugin

First, download, build and install the Huawei updated Score-P (currently not supported in the Score-P release),
```
git clone https://github.com/shuki-zanyovka/scorep_6.0
```

Then, download and build the UCX plugin,

```
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/shuki-zanyovka/scorep_plugin_ucx
cd scorep_plugin_ucx
```

To build:

```
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_STANDARD_COMPUTED_DEFAULT=GNU -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_COMPUTED_DEFAULT=GNU -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpic++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc
make
```

# OpenMPI patches

For using with OpenMPI, please review and apply all patches under ./openmpi-patches directory (already applied in HMPI).

# To use, please enable the plugin as follows,

```
export LOCAL_USER_SCOREP_INSTALL_PATH=<Score-P 6.0 Install Path>/scorep-6.0
export SCOREP_PLUGIN_UCX_PATH=<Plugin Path>/scorep_plugin_ucx/BUILD
export OMPI_PATH=<OpenMPI Install Path>
```

# Set path for the UCX installation 

```
export UCX_INSTALL_PATH=<UCX installation path, profiling enabled>/ucx-prof
export UCS_LIB_PATH="$UCX_INSTALL_PATH/lib:$UCX_INSTALL_PATH/lib/ucx"

export PATH=$OMPI_PATH/bin:$LOCAL_USER_SCOREP_INSTALL_PATH/bin:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SCOREP_PLUGIN_UCX_PATH:$SCOREP_PLUGIN_MPI_PATH:$OMPI_PATH:$UCS_LIB_PATH:$LOCAL_USER_SCOREP_INSTALL_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# When using UCX@N, the number of UCX counters stored is limited to max = N. For example,

```
export SCOREP_METRIC_SCOREP_PLUGIN_MPI=UCX@20
```

# Disable profilin and enable tracing,

```
export SCOREP_ENABLE_PROFILING=false
export SCOREP_ENABLE_TRACING=true
export SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=4000M
```

# It is recommended to use a Score-P filter file to reduce Score-P overhead,

```
export SCOREP_FILTERING_FILE=./filter.scorep
```

# It is recommended to apply a UCX statistics filter as follows,

```
export UCX_STATS_FILTER="rx_am*,bytes_short,bytes_bcopy,bytes_zcopy,rx*,tx*"
```

# UCX should be configured to send statistics via UDP,

```
export UCX_STATS_DEST="udp:localhost:37873"
```

# Contact us at,

# Enable tracing

```
export SCOREP_ENABLE_TRACING=true
```

# Note, that profiling must be disabled when using the UCX data acquisition plugin

```
export SCOREP_ENABLE_PROFILING=false

export SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY=1000M

export UCX_STATS_DEST="udp:localhost:37873"
```

# Apply filter:

```
